 💻**Movie Application**

+ Built a [movie](https://627bc24d3f081c14701a9486--regal-bonbon-8701fd.netlify.app/) app with React.js, Redux for state management, and  redux toolkit for the API request. This program gives you access to thousands of movies at your leisure.
+ Created a [movie](https://glistening-salmiakki-58b407.netlify.app) series collection that allows users to filter movies based on category and genre. It provides you the week's most popular movies and people, as well as a YouTube preview for each series.

 💻 **Ecommerce Applications**
 
+ Built a product [app](https://profound-starlight-ed42a2.netlify.app) for ecommerce that uses redux hook for state management and semantic ui for styling. It retrieves a sequence of products using the product ID and displays each with its own unique details.
+ Create a cloth store app that categorizes things, uses redux for state management, firebase for authentication, and integrates Stripe for the payment interface.

💻**Restaurant Applications**
 
 + With React.js and the Redux library for state management, I created a [restaurant](https://628a95c763d6b21cda541df3--courageous-cascaron-aa8ddf.netlify.app/) page. This page allows you to explore available meal by category and order available meals.


 💻  **Whatsapp Applications**
